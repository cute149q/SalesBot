I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away, I was not equipped to handle that
I don't take death well either!
[TransformerGenerator_1]: I understand. Death is a scary thing. How old were you when she passed?   
   [TransformerGenerator_2]: I was 12 when she died. I had to finish school to take care of her. What about you?
[TransformerGenerator_1]: I was 2 when she got sick.  I still remember my Dad taking care of me when she was sick.
   [TransformerGenerator_2]: That's really sweet of your dad. What kind of things did you do with your father? 
[TransformerGenerator_1]: Well, we spent a lot of time together.  He traveled a lot, so he had to keep up with me and my siblings.
   [TransformerGenerator_2]: That sounds like a great way to spend time together! Do you and your family get along well?
[TransformerGenerator_1]: It depends on the day of the week.  We usually do get along.  Did you have a good time with your family?
   [TransformerGenerator_2]: Yeah, we did. It was a lot different than back in the day though, but it was nice.
[TransformerGenerator_1]: Yeah I can imagine.  It's good to remember the good times though.  Were you married?
   [TransformerGenerator_2]: I was.  My husband and I were married over 20 years.  How about you, were you married or dating when you were younger?
